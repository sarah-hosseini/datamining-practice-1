# datamining-practice-1
This is my practice in data mining and my first step in data analysis.

I worked with some simple visualization libraries and did some data preprocessing.

Then, I  used my preprocessed dataset to cluster via several methods, and found the best parameters for clustering, and wrote down my observations and characteristics of each cluster. 

The data is from a marketing campaign.
